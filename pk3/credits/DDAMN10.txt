Description             : MegaWad for The Ultimate Doom, with the purpose to
                          be a reboot of the original game. Meant to be
                          experienced in pure vanilla fashion. Some novel
                          ideas here and there, and an attempt to push the
                          engine to its limits at times, but mostly a
                          "traditional" wad, with a 'gameplay first' mindset,
                          and without any of the modern trends of wad design,
                          like ultra-realistic visuals, walking sims, or
                          slaughtermaps.
