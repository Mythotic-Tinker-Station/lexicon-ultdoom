Misc. Author Info       : We are now 20 years older from the time the first
                          version of 2002ado was released. We no longer live
                          with our parents and are now proudly battling it
                          out independently in our lives.

Description             : A classic-style megawad for the Ultimate Doom
                          containing 5 all new episodes, great architecture,
                          more interconnected layouts, and lots of hard work
                          put into every level plus all new music too. The
                          maps follow a similar theme to the original
                          Ultimate Doom, Death Tormention series and SIGIL.

Additional Credits to   : The community for all their input and feedback
                          during the release of the public betas. All the
                          authors for the Utilities which made this megawad
                          possible. ID software of course for allowing all us
                          authors and others to create addon levels for their
                          games over the past 30 years or so. And myself for
                          making sure this great megawad would be completed
                          and not go dead like some other megawads such as
                          Doom Millennium!.
