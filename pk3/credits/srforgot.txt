Description             : During the development of Switcheroom there were 18 additional 
                          maps made for the project that were rejected for various 
                          reasons. Such as not resembling the original map, making the 
                          incorrect map, or being replaced with a better submission.

                          The Forgotten maps is not intended to be played continuously. 
                          The ZMAPINFO will pistol start you at the beginning of the 
                          next map when you reach the exit.

                          E2M5 & E2M7 have secret exit locations, but they act as normal exits
