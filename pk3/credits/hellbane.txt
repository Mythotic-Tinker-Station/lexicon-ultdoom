Story       		: The red dust of a forsaken planet, far away into the fringes
			  of existence, blows away all hope as a new threat arises from
			  the dark, one filled with horns and flesh mutations of steel.
			  Humanity is but a small obstacle in their path towards
			  domination. No man can stand their path, no weapon can truly
			  kill them all, for demons is what they are... and you need
			  a demon to kill a demon.
			  At the dawn of a new age, hell's bane comes.

==========================================================================
Description		: A 36 level megawad for Ult. Doom replacing all 4 episodes.
			  It's a collection of my levels released over the past
			  25 years, so it's kind of anniversary release. Also, this
			  is the year that Doom turns 30. congratulations Doom!
			  Most levels you will recognize if you're familiar with my
			  work while a few levels are brand new for this release.
			  Some levels have seen minor or major alterations.
			  I just that no matter how many levels you've played or
			  haven't played, that you you will enjoy playing these
			  levels. I've tried to avoid a simple copy and paste
			  affair and have spent almost 2 years on making this
			  an interesting, engaging and exciting compilation
			  despite the very obvious reuse and recycling present.
			  It is after all an anthology :)

			  New custom skies from scratch by me. I also made some
			  liquid textures. Use them if you please in your own levels;
			  just remember to credit me, thanks.

			  
			  IMPORTANT INFORMATION:

			  *************************************************
			  Pistol start intended, but feel free to play continuously.

			  Jumping and mouselook NOT intended. May break progression
			  if you do. Noclipping definitely not recommended.

			  The episode 3 sky will have a little ugliness in it if
			  you use GZDoom in software renderer mode with capped
			  skies on. Nothing mayor, just ignore it.

			  Load hb_stbar.wad after hellbane.wad if you prefer a fullscreen
			  status bar.

			  Damaging floors: Nukage 2-5%. Lava 5-10%. Water and blood no damage.
			  
			  IMPORTANT SOURCEPORT NOTE:		
			  In order for the boss levels to function correctly
			  you will need one of these sourceports or newer.
			  The wad requires a sourceport that supports UMAPINFO
			  if you want the intended experience:

			  DSDA-Doom 0.26.2
			  PrBoom+ 2.5.17um
			  PrBoom+ 2.6.66-ucrt64
			  PrBoom+ 2.61um-w32
			  Woof 11.2.0-win64 
			  GZDoom dev builds from 16th July 2023 onwards
			  (boss levels wont work in GZDoom 4.10)
