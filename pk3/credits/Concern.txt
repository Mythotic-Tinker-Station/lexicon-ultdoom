Misc. Author Info       : Is doom mapping really using my chemistry degree???

Description             : 3 episode wad for ultimate doom with the usual tech/hell tech/hell setup with a few 			  		  exceptions from time to time. This is an expansion from my cbspeed.wad I realeased last 	  			  August, so the first episode is an updated version of cbspeed with hopefully improved 		          	  gameplay and layout flow. Episodes 2 and 3 were solely built from scratch. The wad is 			          designed to hopefully give a varied and at times challenging gameplay experience.

Additional Credits to   : ID Games for doom
			  The artists/games/tv shows for which the music for this wad comes from.
			  Larzuk and Nevan for playtesting throughout development (pre-beta) 
			  Ribbiks for some useful beta fdas, Steve D and kakhome1 for extensive beta testing.

Story

In the year 2150, scientists have finally started to crack the deep internal secrets of time, space and matter. Using the CERN facility as it's based, the UAC had manged to carry out revolutionary research into new particles, but also the transport of matter. Things seem to be going well, but alas things were about to change. One day there was a huge power surge from the northern section of the collider complex. Suddenly monsters of unknown origin started pouring out of a gapping whole created inside the particle accelerator. All those inside the complex died or succumbed to a much worse fate. 
Luckily you were outside the facility and in case of an emergency a lockdown proceedure is innitiated which stops the spread of contamination. But even this was struggling with the demonic forces present. Given the lack of time for planning. You decide to head back to the base itself and stop this invasion before it's too late.
