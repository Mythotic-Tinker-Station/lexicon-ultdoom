Editor(s) used          : Various (Pcorf: Doomcad 6.1, Doom Builder 1.68 and
                          2.1, Wintex 4.3, XWE 1.16, Slade 3.1.0.1, Cakewalk
                          music software for midis)
Known Bugs              : None if you use Zdoom or MAPINFO compatible ports.

			  If playing in Boom (or Prboom), E2M8 and E3M8 do
                          not end as intended and you cannot access the super
                          secret levels in Episode 2 and Episode 4. This is
                          because the first two Death Tormention episodes
                          replaced Episode 4. Please read the
                          DTPACK_readme.txt for more info about changes and
                          fixes. If you play this in Zdoom, it works as
                          intended due to the MAPINFO entry.

			  If you play this in Prboom-plus the secret levels
			  in E2 and E3 don't work properly. E2M2 takes you to
			  E2M9 but you return to E2M6. E3M2 takes you to E3M9
			  but you return to E3M7. This is because it does not
			  support MAPINFO.

			  ZDOOM is reccomended due to the MAPINFO entry!

May Not Run With        : Vanilla Doom
