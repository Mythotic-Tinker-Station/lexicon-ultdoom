It is worth noting that these maps are much ore challenging than most Ultimate Doom episodes, and whilst these won't reach the difficulty of the hardest wads out there, some of these maps will push you. Difficulty settings are there to help on some of the tougher maps or indeed those that play by a different set of rules. I would say on average this is around the level seen in UDINO.
