Description             : Nostalgia Zero is a set of 36 maps in CL3 for The
                          Ultimate Doom. This WAD uses exclusively vanilla
                          textures and vanilla limits, with the target source
                          port being Chocolate Doom. In terms of gameplay and
                          level design it s much closer to the IWAD than
                          either of the Nostalgia WADs, though it does
                          sometimes dip it s toes into more modern tropes.
