Description             : A 4 episode ultimate doom megawad containing 36
                          maps. Most are loosely based on the original
                          ultimate doom levels but with unique layouts and
                          gameplay, the maps are inspired rather than being
                          direct remakes. Difficulty is fairly average, later
                          levels should provide a decent challenge without
                          getting frustrating or tedious.
