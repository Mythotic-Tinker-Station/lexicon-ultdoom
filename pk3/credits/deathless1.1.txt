Description             : A speedily-done Ultimate Doom megawad.
                          
                          The 27 layouts for the three new episodes were first
                          blocked out starting midnight 1st Nov. The 27th map
                          was thingplaced and balanced at about midnight on
                          10th Nov, so the total build time for this is 9 days.
                          A number of days after release were spent on finding
                          bugs and balancing the maps for single and co-op play.

                          No jumping or crouching (enforced). Freelook allowed.

                          As with this mapset's predecessor Griefless, ***A
                          LIMIT-REMOVING PORT IS RECOMMENDED***. Chocolate Doom
                          may not handle some of these maps, and is completely
                          untested.
                          
                          Crispy Doom is recommended for the best experience
                          while playing this.
                          
                          The difficulty of the set is also fairly easy-going,
                          particularly early on. For extra challenge if desired,
                          the author recommends adding -fast and/or -solo-net to
                          the command line.
                          
Additional Credits to   : Big thanks to Ryath for organizing "NaNoWADMo" and
                          giving me an excuse to be a bastard by pulling crap
                          like this out of the ether in substantially less than
                          the month that was allotted.

                          Special thanks to Alfonzo and Fuzzball for a fun co-op
                          testing session, and to all those who provided
                          feedback and demos in the thread and the NaNoWADMo
                          discord.

                          Thanks also to TeamTNS for hosting this on Thursday
                          Night Survival two weeks running!
                          
                          Endless thanks to id Software and Bethesda for
                          officially sanctioning this mapset and featuring it as
                          an add-on for the new PC/console port of Doom! So cool.
