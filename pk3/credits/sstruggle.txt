Description             : Solar Struggle is an Ultimate Doom, limit-removing
                          (Complevel 3) community project. Each map was given
                          a name first and then participants were invited to
                          make a level based of it.
                          
                          You are an unnamed convict imprisoned on Titan.
                          When demon invasion threatens the Solar System, he
                          gets a chance to escape. But there's a horde of
                          demons between you and freedom.
                          
                          The first 3 episodes are comparatively easy and
                          short, and the 4th is ramping difficulty up quite a
                          bit. The maps are balanced for pistol-start
                          primarily.
                          
                          The WAD is using UMAPINFO for level names on the
                          automap, text screens and custom intermission art.
                          It should not have any effect on gameplay, but it
                          is where all the text is. So, it is recommended you
                          use something that supports is such as newer
                          versions of the gzDoom, DSDA-Doom or PrBoom+.
